# balenaCaddy

## Status
* Works!!!
* Needs to be documented properly
* Uses device variables to config the Caddyfile
* Wildcard certificates are working!!
* ACME provisioning works (digital ocean tested sat)
* The python is pretty janky...

## TODO
1. Document
2. Figure out how to publish as an app on [Balena Hub](https://hub.balena.io)
3. Test other DNS providers for the ACME provisioning
